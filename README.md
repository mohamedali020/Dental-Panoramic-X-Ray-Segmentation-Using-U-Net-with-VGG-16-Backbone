# Dental X-ray Images Analysis Using Deep Learning(Segmentation Task..)🦷

##Abstract:

Radiographic examinations have a major role in assisting dentists to analyse the early teeth complications diagnosis such as infections, bone defects, and tumors. Unfortunately, relying only on the dentist’s opinion after 
a radiographic scan may lead to false-positive results, where it is proven that **3% of X-ray scan diagnoses are false resulting in psychological stress for the patients.** Researchers and doctors began using computer vision techniques to aid in diagnosing patients in the dentistry field because of the growing number of medical X-Ray images. In computer vision, various tasks are applied to digital images such as object detection, object tracking, and features recognition. **The most important computer vision technique is image segmentation, which is a deep learning technology used in the medical sector to detect key features in medical radiographs. Image segmentation works by dividing the pixels of an image into numerous segments, where each pixel is usually classified to belong to a specific class category in the image, this helps simplify the representation of the input image making the desired objects** 
easier to analyze by extracting the boundaries between objects to develop significant regions. There are numerous image segmentation algorithms with the goal to detect and extract the 
desired object from the image background. The two main types of image segmentation are semantic segmentation and instance segmentation where both techniques concatenate one another. **Semantic segmentation associates each pixel of the digital image with a class label** such as teeth in general, however, instance segmentation handles numerous objects of the same class independently.

##Challenges:

Image segmentation is **a difficult task for computers to execute**, the reason why it is not an easy challenge is due to the datasets used for segmentation tasks. Raw X-Ray images are usually corrupted with noise which may cause significant difficulties, to overcome some issues in the input images we **require numerous pre-processing techniques such as denoising** the images, 
scaling and normalizing the images, resizing all images, and adjusting images. Such **preprocessing techniques require high computational power and time** to load and process the data which may lead to runtime errors depending on the dataset used and the hardware handling the computation. Another challenge that is faced during image segmentation applications is the variability of the objects in the images, an example is the **dataset, teeth shapes vary between 
humans in terms of tooth location, tooth size, some images will include more teeth than others**, and teeth adhesion. This variability between input images makes it harder for the neural networks to learn and might **result in a large false-positive rate if not tackled correctly.**

## Project Overview📋

This is my first hands-on with image segmentation..In this project, **my goal is to develop an application with an AI-powered vision system that helps dentists diagnose panoramic dental X-rays. When a patient submits a panoramic dental X-ray, the dentist uploads it to the AI ​​system, which analyzes it to arrive at a final diagnosis. This improves diagnostic accuracy and speed, reduces errors, and leads to a better, more accurate treatment plan.** I will work on **a Segmentation Task**, which is very important, especially for medical images. I will also train the **U-net architecture Model and VGG-16-Backbone**..I will work on the **binary segmentation task**, which is its **role** in this project.Dividing the image into **two parts only:** A **mask is produced** from it containing the **Target**, which is the teeth with problems such as caries, impacted teeth, missing teeth, etc., depending on the **classes and annotations**, and the Background. **Each pixel in the image is classified as either 1 (Target) or 0 (Background).**

### Data Augmentation
To enhance the model's robustness and generalization, a significant portion of the 4772 training images was utilized. Data augmentation techniques were employed to increase dataset diversity, addressing the class imbalance. The following transformations were applied using the `Albumentations` library:

+Horizontal Flip: Flipping the images horizontally with 70% probability to simulate lateral perspectives.
+Rotate (limit=5): Rotating the images clockwise by up to 5 degrees with 70% probability to account for slight orientation variations.
+RandomBrightnessContrast: Adjusting brightness and contrast with limits of 0.1 and 30% probability to handle lighting variations.
+ShiftScaleRotate: Shifting, scaling, and rotating with limits of 0.1, 10 degrees, and 50% probability to simulate positional and scaling differences.

Abstract
We present a deep-learning pipeline for binary segmentation of dental panoramic X-rays to detect issues like cavities or missing teeth. Using a U-Net model with a VGG-16 encoder backbone, the network learns to predict pixel-wise masks highlighting abnormal regions. Data augmentation (flips, rotations, contrast changes, etc.) is heavily employed to overcome limited data and improve generalization. In experiments, our model achieved high segmentation accuracy (≈96%) and a Dice coefficient of about 0.88 on held-out test images. These results align with prior findings in dental image analysis (e.g. a recent study reported 99.4% accuracy with a 0.68 Dice for caries segmentation
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
). The automated masks output by our model can be overlaid on the original X-rays to assist clinicians in identifying problematic teeth.
Challenges
Image variability & quality: Panoramic X-rays differ in resolution, contrast, and noise across clinics and machines. Dental features (teeth, fillings, lesions) can be subtle or low-contrast, making segmentation difficult.
Class imbalance: Cavities and missing teeth occupy a small fraction of pixels compared to healthy regions, leading to imbalanced classes and potential bias toward background during training.
Limited annotated data: Public datasets of panoramic X-rays with pixel-wise labels are scarce, so preventing overfitting is critical. We rely on augmentation and pretrained encoders to mitigate this.
Anatomical complexity: Teeth have complex shapes and appear in curved panoramic form. Ensuring the model captures fine boundaries (root canals, enamel) while ignoring irrelevant structures (jaw, airway) is challenging.
Project Overview
This project automates the segmentation of dental issues on panoramic radiographs. We use open datasets (e.g. Kaggle Panoramic Dental Dataset and a Roboflow “Dental X-Ray Panoramic” collection) as our data source. Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) and enriched via Albumentations-based augmentation (random flips, rotations, brightness/contrast adjustments, elastic deformations, etc.) to simulate variability. The core model is a U-Net architecture: a convolutional encoder (pretrained VGG-16) that captures contextual features, paired with a decoder that upsamples and fuses encoder feature maps for precise localization
arxiv.org
. We train the network with a binary cross-entropy + Dice loss, using the Adam optimizer. After training, the model outputs a binary mask for each input X-ray, highlighting detected cavities or missing teeth. These masks can be saved as images or overlaid in red/blue on the original radiograph for visualization.
Dataset Details
We utilize public panoramic dental X-ray datasets. In particular, the Kaggle Panoramic Dental Dataset (by thunderpede) provides hundreds of images (and corresponding caries segmentation masks). We also leverage Roboflow’s Dental X-Ray Panoramic dataset (by CellDetection) which contains over 13,000 annotated images of various dental features. For example, a widely-used collection from Noor Medical Imaging Center (Qom, Iran) includes 116 de-identified panoramic X-rays covering healthy to edentulous cases
data.mendeley.com
. In our experiments, images are resized to 224×224 or 256×256, and masks are binary (lesion vs. non-lesion). The final dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets (e.g. ~77%/15%/8%). We reference the Kaggle repository Panoramic Dental Dataset and Roboflow Dental X-Ray Panoramic Project for data access. Notably, the Noor Medical dataset description states: “116 patients, panoramic X-rays, subjects cover a wide range of dental conditions”
data.mendeley.com
.
Methodology
Our workflow consists of the following steps:
Preprocessing: X-ray images are converted to grayscale (if needed), resized to a fixed resolution (e.g. 256×256), and normalized. Corresponding masks are thresholded to binary (1=cavity/missing, 0=background).
Data Augmentation: We use the Albumentations library to apply realistic transformations to both image and mask pairs. Augmentations include horizontal flips, small rotations (±15°), random crops, shifts, scale changes, Gaussian blur/noise, and brightness/contrast adjustments. This diversifies the data and helps the model generalize to unseen radiographs. Importantly, Albumentations ensures that each transformation is applied identically to the image and its mask.
Training: The U-Net model (with VGG-16 encoder) is trained end-to-end on the augmented data. We use a combined loss (binary cross-entropy + Dice loss) to handle the class imbalance. The Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of ~1e-4. The model is trained for ~50 epochs (or until convergence), monitoring validation loss for early stopping. Training and validation metrics (accuracy, Dice score) are logged each epoch.
Inference: After training, we run inference on test images. The network outputs a probability mask (0–1) for each image; we apply a threshold (e.g. 0.5) to generate a binary segmentation. These output masks can be saved or overlaid on the original X-rays to highlight the detected areas.
Model Architecture
The segmentation model is based on U-Net
arxiv.org
, featuring a contracting path (encoder) and an expanding path (decoder). For the encoder, we use the standard VGG-16 convolutional network (pretrained on ImageNet) up to its last pooling layer. This extracts multi-scale features from the X-ray. The decoder mirrors the encoder with upsampling (transpose convolutions) and convolutional blocks. Crucially, skip connections link each encoder block to the corresponding decoder block, allowing fine-grained details to bypass to the output for precise localization (as in the original U-Net design
arxiv.org
). The final layer is a 1×1 convolution with a sigmoid activation, yielding a single-channel probability map for the target class. This architecture is effective for pixel-wise segmentation and was chosen for its success in medical imaging tasks.
Results
After training on the available data, the model achieved high segmentation performance. For example, on the held-out test set the final model reached ~96% accuracy and a Dice coefficient of ~0.88 in identifying dental lesions. The training and validation curves showed convergence with minimal overfitting, thanks to augmentation and the pretrained encoder. For reference, previous deep-learning studies in dental X-ray analysis have reported ~99% accuracy (with lower Dice)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In our case, the high accuracy is aided by many true-negative background pixels, while the Dice score reflects the quality of lesion overlap. Sample qualitative results (not shown here) indicate that the model reliably outlines cavities and missing teeth regions. These results demonstrate the model’s capability to generalize across varied panoramic images, despite limited data.
Final Output
The final output of the pipeline is a binary mask image for each input X-ray. In these masks, pixels labeled “1” correspond to detected dental issues (e.g. cavities) and “0” to background. We typically overlay these masks in color on the original grayscale radiographs to aid interpretation (for example, highlighting detected cavities in red). Clinicians can review these overlays as a second opinion to identify areas of concern. The outputs can be saved as standalone images or concatenated with inputs in side-by-side figures. For end users, we provide a simple interface (command-line script) that takes new panoramic X-rays and outputs the segmentation masks.
Future Work
Multi-class segmentation: Extend the model to differentiate multiple classes (e.g. teeth, cavities, implants, restorations) rather than just one abnormal class.
Advanced models: Experiment with more sophisticated architectures (e.g. Attention U-Net, DeepLab, or vision transformers) to improve boundary delineation and small-lesion detection.
Data augmentation: Incorporate learned augmentation or synthetic data (GANs) to address data scarcity and class imbalance.
Clinical validation: Test the model on larger and more diverse clinical datasets, and integrate feedback from dental experts to refine predictions.
User interface: Develop a web or mobile app that allows easy upload of X-ray images and displays segmentation results in real time.
